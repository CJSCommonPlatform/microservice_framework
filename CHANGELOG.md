### Changed
- Improve ResponsePayloadMatcher to support string matchers on response payload
- Upgraded ObjectMapper to allow single arg constructors in Object serialization

### Added
 - File, file-api and file-alfresco modules
 - File service interface
 - Alfresco file service implementation

### Fixed
 - Refactor random generators for string, uri and email

## [0.34.0] - 2016-11-16

- Proxy support to Rest Client
- JsonObjects toJsonArray method

### Changed
- Improve BigDecimalGenerator to cover both positive and negative range

- TypeCheck class to provide better feedback on failure
- Parent pom to 1.2.0, common bom to 1.4.0 and raml-plugin to 1.3.0

### Fixed
- JDBC Repository resource close ordering
- Test cases related to random date generation
- ValueGenerator to randomly pick items from a given pool and renamed the class to ItemPicker

## [0.33.0] - 2016-10-31

### Added
- Support for RestClient to use proxy details from environment properties
- Matchers for matching handler and handler class methods, annotations and pass through process type (Sender or Requester)
- Empty stream matching to EventStreamMatcher
- toJsonArray utility function

### Changed
- Improved event stream processing

## [0.32.0] - 2016-10-24

### Added
- JsonEnvelope.asJsonObject() for simple conversion of the entire envelope to a JsonObject.
- EventStreamMatcher to match stream of JsonEnvelopes appended
- RestPoller. A polling REST client utility for integration tests
- Mechanism for taking snapshots of aggregates, disabled by default. To enable, add a dependency on
the `aggregate-snapshot-service` module. Requires the `aggregate-snapshot-repository-liquibase`
schema to be applied to the event store.
- JSON schema matching support in the JsonEnvelopeMatcher
- Added new module 'rest-core'
- Added 'rest-client-core' as a standard dependency for event-processor'
- Added 'hamcrest-date' as a standard dependency for 'test-utils-core'

### Changed
- JsonEnvelopeMetadataMatcher to allow matching with JSON paths
- Deprecated PollingRestClient in favour of the new RestPoller

### Fixed
- RestProcessor now allows metadata from payload to be merged with headers instead of being
overwritten
- Removed unwanted dependency on the RAML parser within the REST adapter so that adding the REST client to event processors does not break the application

## 0.31.0 - 2016-10-24

### Fixed
- Event buffer connection held open after exception in event listener

- Hamcrest Matchers for asserting JsonEnvelopes contained within either Streams or Lists
- New Clock interface to replace DateTimeProvider
- EnumPicker in random generators

### Changed
- DateTimeProvider is now deprecated - use Clock instead
- JsonEnvelopeBuilder is now deprecated - use DefaultJsonEnvelope.envelope() instead
- Extend DefaultJsonEnvelope.Builder to accept JsonObject as part of the payload

to the EventStream append method
- DateProvider to allow easy mocking of date creating for testing
- Random generators and TypeCheck class for type-based testing

```
- Added test utility classes for logger producer, test messaging client and other http utilities.

### Changed
- Removed schema validation for requests without a payload (actions without schema/example specified in raml and denoted with !!null).

Example (Two actions, the second has no payload):
```
application/vnd.people.modified-user+json:
    schema: !include json/schema/people.modified-user.json
